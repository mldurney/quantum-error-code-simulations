Fix Windows file name shenanigans -> Done
No function pointers -> Reduced time >30%
Const reference args to functions -> Reduced time ~2% (...Okay?)
Single thread -> Reduced time 25%
0, 1 vs 1, -1 -> Cute in theory, sad in reality
Inline functions (findProbability, findIndexEnergy)
Remove maps -> 10% improvment != worthwhile exchange for flexibility
Stored indInteractions.at(index).end() in variable -> Reduced time ~20%
Switched to MWC and randFloatCO() for random generation -> Reduced time ~30%
