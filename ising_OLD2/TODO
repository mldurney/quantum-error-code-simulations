  *      Enable percentage tracking
  *      Add more parameters

  *      Include option to compare changes

  *      Desired behavior:
  *          Plot of average value of absolute magnetization vs temp

 - Obtain a plot of the average (absolute value) of the magnetization as a function of temperature
 - Establish baseline of results
 - Run different lattice sizes
 - Input in text file
     Each row: lattice size, temperatures specified, num updates per temperature
     Automate generation of text files by Mathematica

   - Focus on nearest-neighbour. We can discuss next nearest neighbours at a later time
  - Change the probability function based off energy difference
  - Optimize the code for calculating energy differences at a given time
  - Obtain a plot of the average (absolute value) of the magnetization as a function of temperature
